# proficiency-projects
Some projects which I have worked on which are useful in learning and becomming proficient at a new coding language 

## Gradient Descent for Optimization
Using only a basic linear-algebra package, implement gradient descent for optimization.

## A Basic 1-layer Neural network
Implement a single-layer NN with a sigmoidal activation, stochastic gradient descent, and back/forward propagation without using a machine learning package.  Test against the MNIST hand-written digits data set.

## Advanced NN
Implement a NN for the MNIST hand-written digits data set using a framework/library of your choice in this particular language.

## Two Balls in a tube under graviaty
Consider two rubber balls in a tube.  Given initial conditions (height and velocity) and mass for each one, predict their trajectories over time.  If a collision occurs, determine their new velocities according to standard elastic collision updates.  

## Fermi Pasta Ulam
Implement the FPU problem for a series of oscillators.  Assume the particles masses are the same, and the springs have the same linear and nonlinear coefficients.  Allow for various intial conditions.

## Ising model
Simulate the Ising model in a square at various temperatures, using a Monte Carlo Metropolis sampling method.

## Heat Equation
Solve the heat equation in a bar with finite differences, using Crank-Nicolson time stepping.

## Recursive QR
Implement QR factorization in a recursive method for an $m \times n$ matrix.

## Finite Elements in 1D
Implement FEM in 1D for $H^1$ elements.

## Markov Chain Metropolis Sampling
Build a method which samples from a scalar Gaussian distribution, but applies metropolis sampling to converge to all minima of a specified function.
